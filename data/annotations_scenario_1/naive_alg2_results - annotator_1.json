The objective of this task is to reduce human efforts as well as reduce man made errors. Even by this companies handle their client 24x7. In this case companies are academic institutions and clients are participants or students. Web scraping using Selenium web driver Python The task is to scrap the data from the online messaging portal in a text format and have to find the pattern form it. Data Visualization and Data insights Hadoop Eco System, Hive, PySpark, QlikSense The goal of this project is to build a Business Solutions to a Internet Service Provider Company, like handling data which is generated per day basis, for that we have to visualize that data and find the usage pattern form it and have a generate a reports. Image Based Fraud Detection Microsoft Face API, PySpark, Open CV The main goal of project is Recognize similarity for a face to given Database images. Face recognition is the recognizing a special face from set of different faces. Face is extracted and then compared with the database Image if that Image recognized then the person already applied for loan from somewhere else and now hiding his or her identity, this is how we are going to prevent the frauds in the initial stage itself.

Project Description: The bank wanted to help its customers to avail different products of the bank through analyzing their expenditure behavior. The customers spending ranges from online shopping, medical expenses in hospitals, cash transactions, and debit card usage etc. the behavior allows the bank to create an analytical report and based on which the bank used to display the product offers on the customer portal which was built using java. The portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis . the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal. The portal used hadoop framework to analyes the data as per the rules and regulations placed by the regulators from the respective countries. The offers and the interest rates also complied with the regulations and all these processing was done using the hadoop framework as big data analytics system.

The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application. Role & Responsibilities: To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries. To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on. Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team. Reporting bugs and bug fixing. Create workflow / batches and set the session dependencies. Implemented Change Data Capture using mapping parameters, SCD and SK generation. Developed Mapplet, reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse.

Project Description: The objective is to implement a strategic technical solution to support the governance and monitoring of break standards - including enhancements to audit capabilities. As a part of this program, the required remediation of source system data feeds involves consolidation of data into standardized feeds. These remediated data feeds will be consumed by ETL layer.
